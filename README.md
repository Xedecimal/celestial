# Xedecimal.net Theme

## Todo

### Get api running again

For some reason the API is returning 404 all the time now.

### Get navigation menus working from theme.

Got the callback and endpoint, just need some more work on translating the data into a real menu.

### Get other elements into page

Tag line and things like that should be available to react app.

### Get things packaged up to put into a github repo.

Put all of this into another repo, or submit to celestial.
